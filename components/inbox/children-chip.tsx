/**
 * This thread's children, in the thread header.
 *
 * The sidebar shows a thread's children — and its children's children — while
 * the family is on screen and expanded. It cannot show them when the user is
 * reading the thread itself and the list is somewhere else: another group tab,
 * a filter that excludes this family, a collapsed project, or a sidebar that is
 * simply not where the eyes are. This chip is that surface. It names the number,
 * and it is the route into a child from inside its parent.
 *
 * A chip was written for this slot early on and never registered — only the
 * parent's chip was, so the file was dead weight and the plugin that forked this
 * one dropped it. It is back as a wired component, under a name that says what
 * it draws: bb's *subagents* are activity counters on a thread, and the thing
 * this chip lists is child *threads*, which is what its own label always said.
 *
 * Its panel is the sidebar's one menu (`Menu` + `MenuRow`) rather than a second
 * one drawn here: a chip that rolled its own rows and its own panel is what the
 * row menus were rebuilt to stop doing.
