/**
 * What the list says when it is not simply showing the live tree.
 *
 * Two surfaces, and the difference between them is the whole point of the
 * recovery path:
 *
 * - A **notice** sits above rows that are real but not current. The tree stays
 *   exactly where the user left it, and the line is the only thing that admits
 *   the refresh did not land. Replacing a good tree over a failed refresh is the
 *   failure this exists to prevent.
 * - A **failure** is the cold case: nothing to draw, and no last answer to fall
 *   back on. It is the only state that owns the whole scroll area, and it is the
 *   only one that offers the retry — which is a real read of bb's own thread
 *   table through the plugin's backend, not a re-render.

/**

 * `onRetry` reads the live view from bb's SDK — the one route back a plugin
 * actually has, since `experimental_useSidebarThreads` has no refetch. It is
 * offered only here, because a retry while rows are on screen would be a button
 * that appears to do nothing: the rows are already as current as they can be.
 *
 * `onUseOriginal` hands the scroll area to bb's own list. A retry can fail, and
 * a user looking at a sidebar that is not working should not have to go into
 * Settings to get a working one — which is exactly what the host's `Original`
 * is for.
