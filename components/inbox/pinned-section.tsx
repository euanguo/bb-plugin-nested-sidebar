/**
 * Pinned roots from every project, above the tree.
 *
 * The section exists because "pinned" and "first inside its project" are
 * different promises. A pin says *keep this where I can see it*, and a row that
 * lives inside a collapsed project — or behind a group tab that excludes that
 * project — is exactly the row a pin was supposed to keep in view.
 *
 * Every row here is the same row the tree draws: `FamilyRow`, so a pinned thread
 * keeps its status, its children, its menu, its split gesture, and its rename.
 * The only difference is where a reorder is written: this section's drops land
 * in bb's own pin order, and the tree's land in the project's family order.
 *
 * The header carries the count because that is the one thing a folded section
 * has to answer — the rows below are pinned, and how many there are.
