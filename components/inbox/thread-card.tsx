/**
 * The pin, as a control rather than a mark.
 *
 * The state is the glyph — solid when the thread is pinned, outlined when it is
 * not — and the press is its toggle, so unpinning is one click on the thing that
 * says pinned. **The colour never carries the state.** It wears exactly what the
 * park buttons beside it wear, so the three read as one row of controls, and the
 * fill is what says which of the two states this one is in. An earlier version
 * drew the unpinned pin a shade lighter and it read as a *disabled* control
 * rather than as a different state of the same one.
 *
 * It is two controls wearing one glyph. **Unpinned it is an action**, one of the
 * three the row reveals under the pointer, and it moves like the other two —
 * same target, same lift, same tinted ground, and an effect of its own in
 * `pin-button.css`. **Pinned it is a state**, drawn at rest, and it moves like
 * nothing at all: a pin that is holding a thread in place should not dance when
 * the pointer passes over it.
 *
 * The 20px target is padding around a 14px glyph, and the 3px on the side facing
 * the next control would be read as space: the cluster's own gap is 6px, so the
 * glyph would sit 9px from the age — and 12px from the snooze button that takes
 * the age's place under the pointer — while the controls around it sit 6px and
 * 8px apart. So the button hands its own inset back on that one side. Trimming
 * the other side would change nothing at all: the cluster is right aligned, and
 * the leading edge of its first child is not what separates anything.
