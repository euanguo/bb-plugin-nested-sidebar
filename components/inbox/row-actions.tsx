/**
 * The trailing controls every row shares.
 *
 * A row exposes at most THREE things: the one action frequent enough to deserve
 * its own button (`+` — start a thread here), the disclosure that says it can
 * open and which way it is now, and a menu holding everything else. The menu is
 * a right-click, so it costs no width and needs no trigger.
 *
 * The disclosure is its own control rather than part of the menu trigger, which
 * is what it used to be. One slot doing both jobs meant the arrow vanished the
 * moment the pointer arrived (the trigger swapped it for three dots), so a row
 * could not be read as open or closed while you were pointing at it — which is
 * exactly when you are deciding whether to click it.

/**
 * Whether the pointer or the keyboard is on a row, for the one thing that swaps

 *
 * Tracked in React rather than with Tailwind group modifiers on purpose: rows
 * nest (a card inside a worktree inside a project), and CSS `group-hover` fires
 * for every ancestor group, which would light up a parent's controls while the
 * pointer is on a child.
