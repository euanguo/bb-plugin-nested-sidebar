/**
 * Live threads read from bb's own SDK, for the case the host's sidebar view is
 * down.
 *
 * `experimental_useSidebarThreads` is the sidebar's normal source, and it has no
 * way to be retried from a plugin — the hook returns state and nothing else, so
 * when the host reports `error` there is no refetch to call. That is a dead end
 * for the user: a whole sidebar replaced by one line, waiting for something
 * outside their control.
 *
 * bb's SDK can answer the same question. The plugin's backend already reaches it
 * for archived threads and for bulk-delete validation, and `threads.list` carries
 * every field a row draws — environment, host, pin, activity, attention. So the
 * recovery read goes through the plugin's own RPC, and the user gets a retry that
 * does something.
 *
 * This is a fallback, not a second source of truth: it is only consulted while
 * the host view is failing, and the host's answer wins the moment it returns.
