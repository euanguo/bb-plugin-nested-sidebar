/**
 * The Pinned section: pinned roots from every project, in bb's own pin order.
 *
 * Pinned used to mean "first inside its project", and that is a weaker promise
 * than the one the word makes. A pin says *keep this where I can see it*; hiding
 * it inside a collapsed project, or behind a group tab that excludes that
 * project, is the one thing a pin is for. Every other sidebar in the ecosystem
 * draws a pinned section above the tree, and bb's own list does too.
 *
 * Two rules make it work rather than merely look right:
 *
 * 1. **The order is bb's, not a private one.** `bb.sdk.threads.reorderPinned`
 *    writes the same order the built-in sidebar drags by, so a pin moved in one
 *    place is in the same place in the other. A private order would make the two
 *    surfaces disagree, which is worse than having no pinned section at all.
 * 2. **A pinned root leaves its project.** It is drawn once, in the section. Two
 *    rows for one thread is a sidebar that cannot be trusted to say how many
 *    things it is showing.
 *
 * The order read is allowed to be incomplete or stale — a thread pinned on
 * another client, or a pin this read has not caught up with — so a pinned family
 * the order does not name lands after the ones it does, by the same creation
 * order the tree uses. Dropping it would hide a pinned thread, which is the
 * failure the section exists to prevent.
