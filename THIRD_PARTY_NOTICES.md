# Third-party notices — Nest

The plugin's own code is MIT, through the fork chain recorded in
[LICENSE](LICENSE): bb's example sidebar, Dockside, the unpublished fork this
repository started from, and this repository.

This package also ships code and artwork from the projects below, under their own
terms. Every entry is MIT licensed; the licence text is given once at the end and
applies to each copyright notice listed here.

## Orca — `stablyai/orca`

MIT License, Copyright (c) 2026 Lovecast Inc.

The project-icon auto-detection — probing a checkout's conventional icon paths,
sniffing PNG/WebP bytes, resolving a declared `<link rel="icon">` href, and the
`package.json` website-favicon fallback — is ported from Orca at commit
`ca2ae890115faf66ee97e7335caeac061a350524` (2026-09-18). The derived code ships in
`dist/host.js` from `host/project-icon.ts`, and its vocabulary and validation ship in
`dist/server.js` from `lib/project-icons.ts`.

MIT License, Copyright (c) 2026 Michael Yong and Copyright (c) 2026 Yusuf Akbulut.

and motion (`components/inbox/settle-button.css`, `components/inbox/thread-card.tsx`),

`components/inbox/thread-inbox.tsx`), and the live working-duration model
(`lib/working-since.ts`, `hooks/use-working-since.ts`,
`components/inbox/status-slot.tsx`) are ported from BB Sidebar at commit
`e3f60343fecbe1bfa552070724514a3c2f74cf1f` (2026-09-19). They ship in `dist/app.js`

## Not shipped here

React, `@radix-ui/react-select`, `@radix-ui/react-context-menu` and `@bb/plugin-sdk`
are **not** bundled in this package. The bb app provides them at run time, so their
licences travel with bb, not with this plugin.

## Trademarks and brand marks

The provider glyphs drawn from `lib/provider-marks.ts` depict third-party brands:
OpenAI, Claude, Pi, Cursor, Grok Build, Hermes Agent, opencode and oh-my-pi. Each mark
belongs to its owner.

**No licence above grants trademark rights**, and none is claimed here. The marks
identify the agent a user has chosen to run, which is nominative use. A host-served
logo always takes precedence over the vendored geometry and is drawn as a muted
silhouette rather than in brand color.
