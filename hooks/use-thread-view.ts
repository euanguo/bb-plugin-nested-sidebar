/**
 * The threads the tree draws, resolved across the host view and a recovery read.
 *
 * `experimental_useSidebarThreads` is the source of truth and has no refetch, so
 * this hook does two things the raw state cannot:
 *
 * 1. It keeps the last answer the host gave while it was `ready`, so a refresh
 *    that fails leaves the tree standing instead of blanking it.
 * 2. It can read the live view from bb's SDK through the plugin's own backend,
 *    which is the only way back when the host view has failed and there is no
 *    last answer to fall back on.
 *
 * The resolution itself is in `lib/thread-snapshot.ts`; this file is the state
 * machine around it.
