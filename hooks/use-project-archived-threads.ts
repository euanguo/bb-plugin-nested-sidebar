/**
 * A project's newest archived threads, for the shelf under its list.
 *
 * The archive is where finished work goes, and bb's own sidebar view cannot show
 * it — that view is built from queries pinned to `archived: false`, which is the
 * same fact the settled shelf exists for. So recovering a thread you archived a
 * week ago meant a search, even when you knew which project it was in.
 *
 * Three decisions worth stating:
 *
 * - **Per project, on demand.** Only the projects whose shelf is turned on are
 *   read, and the read is bounded by `limit`. A sidebar that read every project's
 *   archive on every mount would pay for a surface almost nobody has open.
 * - **The rows are read, not remembered.** No cache, no snapshot: the shelf is
 *   the one surface where being wrong is worst, because the whole point is
 *   finding something that is *not* on screen.
 * - **Unarchiving goes through the plugin's own `unsettle`.** That is the same
 *   call the settled shelf makes, and it does exactly the right thing for a
 *   thread Nest never settled: it takes bb's archive off the id and clears a row
 *   that is not there. It also means a failure gets the retry prompt the settled
 *   shelf gets, rather than a second, quieter failure path.
